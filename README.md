# Ensemble-Interface-DiskSpace-Test
A framework to test for disk space consumption for Ensemble interfaces. 

It has a dual purpose - 
To aid in estimating the required disk space interfaces will consume (both database file growth and journal files) 
As well as verifying the Ensemble Purge mechanism will indeed clean out all the interfaces' related data 

See class reference (specifically of the InterfaceDiskSpace.Main class) for documentation and usage guidelines
